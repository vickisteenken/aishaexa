Those were two of the few 'mobile' games I've played that I feel had an actual game experience, just shrunk down and adapted for touch. I hate that EA decided it just wasnt worth maintaining them and now there is no way to get or play them. I just wanted to reminisce about them since I've finally given up on ever playing them again. I guess does anyone have any games along those lines they can recommend. Mass Effect at IGN: walkthroughs, items, maps, video tips, and strategies. I've spent about 3 or 4 hours working on this. How far I am is: Bluestacks rooted, bluestacks convinced it's a HAWAI, app installed, 16 megs of app files replaced with the 700 megs of post download app files, that EA turned off the host server for. You can still find them if you look around. Current state: Program launches, says it is trying to talk to EA to verify something, then gets forever stuck on the EA logo.

I really enjoy console like games that are ported to mobile, such as KOTOR, Oxenfree, and Civilization. I played Infiltrator back in the day not too long after release, and I really miss it. No one I‚Äôve seen talk about it has any idea why EA pulled the app from all stores. I would happily pay for the game again to get a bit of Mass Effect action on the go. What are everyone else‚Äôs thoughts.

I was super late to the smartphone game and never got to play Mass Effect Infiltrator. I know it's not necessary to play, especially going into Andromeda but either releasing that game or seeing a similarly poised game leading into Andromeda would be fantastic. I plan on replaying the trilogy and rereading the comics but this would be the final piece of the puzzle for me.

Been wanting to buy it but a lot of people have problems Complete Playthrough / No one Left Behind / Insanity Difficulty Well I've finally completed it (along with Dead Space mobile) despite it being one of the first apps I ever downloaded on the iPad. The controls were a tad cumbersome at times and variety was non-existent but that's expected with early mobile games. The visuals however were great and I loved the idea of an extra story slotted in between main releases. I'd love them to release some more mobile games to work alongside Andromeda. The Mass Effect 3 Datapad was also a fun little distraction So, I don't know if many of you know this, but there is a Mass Effect phone game. I found that out recently and tried downloading it. Right off the bat, I found an issue, a major one. I can't move my person. It tells me to put both thumbs on the bottom corners of my phone, and I do that and try moving my thumbs around, but my character doesn't move. Anyone know why? I have uninstalled and reinstalled three times.

I just thought I'd fire up Infiltrator on my iOS 10 iPhone 6 and found that sadly the game doesn't work any longer. It actually boots and connects to Galaxy at War fine, but it has no sound at all, and it looks like some triggers or plot flags are broken. I get to a room where a big fight is supposed to happen and no enemies spawn or anything. It's a shame. It was a reasonably fun game, granted ME3 war assets. It's too bad EA pulled the plug on supporting it. It was fairly AAA as far as mobile.
